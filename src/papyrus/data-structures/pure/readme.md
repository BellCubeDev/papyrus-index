# Papyrus Index - Pure Data Structures
The "pure" data structures are intended to be JSON-serializable. Scripts and structs and such are referenced by name, not by reference. This is not, however, efficient for computerized usage and is rather intended for data transfer, storage, and initial data generation.

Indexed types can be found in the neighboring `indexing` folder.
