# Contributing to the Papyrus Index

I'm always open to any contributions you may have. If you're looking to contribute but don't know what to do, there are some important ways you can help out:

### Suggest New Scripts

There are a LOT of developer-oriented Papyrus APIs and libraries out there. If you know of one that isn't listed in the Papyrus Index, check if it would qualify by reading [the Inclusion Criteria](./data/README.md#inclusion-criteria) and then [add an issue](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/issues/new) with the details. I'll take a look and see if it's a good fit!

### Testing & Reporting Bugs

I can't humanly test every scenario. Naturally, people (like you!) are going to find bugs. If you do find one, please [report it](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/issues/new) with as much detail as you can. If you can reproduce it, that's amazing! If you can't reproduce it, that's okay tooâ€”report it anyway and we'll see what we can do.

### Feature Requests & User Feedback

More ideas, more better! If you have a suggestion that you think might help make the Papyrus Index more useful, [add an issue](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/issues/new) and I'll gladly take a look!

If you've found something confusing when working with the Index (or just want to say thanks), I'd love to hear from you! [Add an issue](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/issues/new) or [start a discussion](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/discussions/new) and let me know what you think!

### Direct Contributions (Styling, New Features, etc.)

If you're familiar (or willing to get familiar) with the project structure and/or React and/or Next.js and/or the custom tech this project requires, you're always welcome to submit a pull request directly. I'll review it and we'll see where it goes from there! Anything is fair game, especially if you want to address [an existing issue](/BellCubeDev/papyrus-index/issues)!

### Translation

The Papyrus Index is not accepting localization contributions at this time.
