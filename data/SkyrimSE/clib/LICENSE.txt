Use of any of this code is completely free and granted in perpetuity (as long as the mod itself doesn't run afoul of some law somewhere or cause harm to others or violate the TOS of the Nexus, etc, etc).  So, download it, open it up, look for what you want and just copy and paste!  As time goes by I'm finding ways to separate modules and thus make the process of only being limited even easier.
